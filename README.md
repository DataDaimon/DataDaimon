I am a Data Scientist and AI researcher at NASA‚Äôs Space Mission Analysis Branch within the Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate, and a PhD candidate in Data Science at Northwestern University studying neuromorphic computing and cooperative game theory for AI. I combine rigorous financial and systems analysis for multi-billion-dollar aerospace programs with research-driven AI and ML engineering to advance robust, scalable intelligence for high-consequence domains.

At NASA I architect data pipelines, real-time decision analytics, and technical risk models that protect mission integrity across procurement, schedule, and operations. I apply modern ML methods from probabilistic modeling and uncertainty quantification to deep scalable learning and neuromorphic accelerators to convert static financial artifacts into dynamic, explainable decision systems. I also serve as an agency-level AI advisor, bridging research, systems engineering, and strategic policy across NASA and industry partners.

My research agenda focuses on practical and theoretical pathways toward safe, cooperative, and generalizable AI. I study neuromorphic hardware-software co-design to reduce latency and energy cost for continual online learning, and I use cooperative game theory to formalize multi-agent credit assignment, incentive alignment, and distributed value learning. I seek architecture and evaluation paradigms that are both scientifically audacious and immediately useful for aerospace and other safety-critical systems.

Research
1.	Cooperative game theoretical credit assignment for multi-agent learning
    o	Formalize Shapley-inspired credit allocation methods that scale to temporally extended tasks.
o	Apply to multi-vehicle coordination and distributed resource allocation, optimizing both team reward and individual incentive compatibility.

2.	Modular, composable AGI curricula with provable transfer bounds
o	Design architectures of specialized modules (perception, planning, memory) and protocols for gating and composition.
o	Prove and empirically validate transfer generalization bounds under curriculum distributions, measure catastrophic forgetting.

3.	Causal representation learning for robust generalization
o	Learn disentangled causal factors using interventional-style data augmentation and invariance objectives.
o	Integrate learned causal units into decision-making pipelines to improve OOD performance in mission scenarios.

4.	Hybrid symbolic-neural meta-reasoning for long-horizon planning
o	Combine symbolic planning primitives with neural heuristics and learned value functions for reasoning under partial observability.
o	Benchmark on hierarchical mission planning tasks with sparse rewards.
