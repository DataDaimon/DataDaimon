The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” - Steve Jobs<br><br>

I have always been driven by a single question: How do we build better models of the world? My career has been a journey through the different ways we answer that starting with the deterministic foundations of Physics and evolving into the high-stakes world of Operations Research and Data Science.

During my three years as a Data Scientist at NASA, I focused on the intersection of large-scale datasets and mission-critical accuracy. Working in an environment where the margin for error is near zero taught me how to scale analytical models that are both robust and actionable. It wasn't just about the data; it was about the systems-level thinking required to support complex, multi-year objectives.

Currently I serve as a Modeling & Simulation Specialist. My work is focused on the architecture of decision-support systems. By leveraging my background in physics and data analytics, I develop high-fidelity simulations that help stakeholders navigate uncertainty and forecast outcomes in increasingly volatile environments. I view simulation not just as a tool, but as a laboratory for strategy.

Beyond my professional role, I am currently a PhD student in Data Science. My research is dedicated to the evolution of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its potential to redefine how we approach complex systems. I believe the next frontier of modeling lies in the bridge between human-centric game theory and autonomous agent-based systems.

**Core Competencies**<br>

- Developing computational frameworks for strategic forecasting and system dynamics.
- MS in Data Analytics and 3+ years of experience in mission-critical environments.
- MBA focused on the integration of technical innovation with organizational goals.
